# 🧊 Rubik's Cube Solver App

The **Rubik's Cube Solver App** is an interactive web-based application designed to take a scrambled cube as input and return the optimal solution to solve it. It combines a user-friendly front-end interface with a powerful Java backend that processes the cube state and uses solving algorithms.
